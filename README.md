Motion Detector
===============

This repository contains all the files I'll be producing during my first stab
at building a motion sensor with an ESP8266 from scratch. The idea is to place
it on my mailbox, and it will detect when people are at the door.

I will be designing a board for the whole thing, and will be sending it out to
OSHPark for production (first try, let's see how it goes!).

## Parts list

* ESP8266
* PIR motion sensor
* 2K resistor
* 2 Push buttons
* 1 x female JST (2 pins)
* 1 x female JST (3 pins)
* 3 male header pins

## Construction

1. Order the board

   Generate the Gerber files from the included Fritzing sketch, and send them
   out for production (I sent them to OSHPark). You can edit the sketch as
   needed, moving things around, re-routing, adding cool stuff to the silk
   screen...

2. Mount the components

3. Load the program into the ESP8266

4. Profit!
